Construction that has been provided to show preview image for course lessons does not work (previewImageLink + '/' + lesson.order + '.webp')
To avoid problems with a preview image for course lessons I used this construction ${previewImageLink}/lesson-${order}.webp

In this app, I completed all of the tasks and additional subtasks (except one with 'Picture in picture' functionality, I had lack of time on this)
